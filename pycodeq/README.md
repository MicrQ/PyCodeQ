*The simplest, fastest pycodestyle linter available!*

PyCodeQ is a fast, simple, and lightweight linter extension for Python in Visual Studio Code. It uses [pycodestyle](https://pycodestyle.pycqa.org/en/latest/) to check your Python files for style issues and instantly highlights problems in your code.

## Features

- Runs `pycodestyle` automatically when you save or open a Python file
- Highlights style issues directly in the editor using VS Code diagnostics
- Command: **PyCodeQ: Run Linter Check** (available in the Command Palette)
- **Configurable path to the `pycodestyle` executable**
- **Ignore specific error codes via settings**
- No configuration requiredâ€”just install and start linting!
